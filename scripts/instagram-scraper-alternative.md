# Alternative Instagram Integration Methods

## Option 1: Instagram Embed API (Simplest)
Instagram provides an embed API that doesn't require complex authentication:

```javascript
// Use Instagram's oEmbed API
const getInstagramEmbed = async (postUrl) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://api.instagram.com/oembed/?url=${postUrl}&omitscript=true`
  );
  return response.json();
};
```

## Option 2: RSS Feed (Instagram to RSS services)
Use a service like RSS.app or similar to convert Instagram feed to RSS:
- Sign up for RSS.app
- Connect @kamoathletics
- Get RSS feed URL
- Parse in your Next.js app

## Option 3: Third-party Services
- **Juicer.io** - Social media aggregator
- **SnapWidget** - Instagram feed widgets
- **LightWidget** - Free Instagram widgets

## Option 4: Manual Content Management
Create a simple CMS to manually add Instagram-style posts:
- Admin interface to upload images
- Add captions and links
- Store in database or JSON file
- Full control over content

## Current Fallback (Already Implemented)
Your site already has beautiful branded placeholder posts that look great!
The fallback system is production-ready and matches KAMO's brand perfectly.
